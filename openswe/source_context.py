"""The shape of ``source_context`` — where a thread came from.

``source_context`` rides along in LangGraph thread metadata and in the baby-sit
watch record, and is read in a dozen modules to answer "which Slack thread /
Linear issue / GitHub issue started this run?".

Two rules make the models here different from the store records:

**Unknown keys survive.** Writers add keys this module has never heard of
(``breakout_from``, per-integration extras), and several call sites read a
context, enrich it, and write it back. ``extra="allow"`` plus
:meth:`SourceContext.dump` (which excludes unset fields) makes that round-trip
byte-identical — a plain ``model_dump`` would inject defaults for every field the
original omitted.

**Parsing never raises.** Thread metadata is written by webhooks and by older
deployments, and is not validated on write. A context that will not parse yields
an empty one, because losing the Slack thread of a run is better than failing it.
