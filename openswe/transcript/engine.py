"""Appending to the transcript log: one transaction, gapless versions, receipts.

``append`` is the only writer. It takes an advisory lock on the thread, reads
the thread's head version, and assigns ``version + 1 ...`` to the commands it
actually appends, so the log is gapless per thread and a reader can resume from
any version with ``version > after``. Events, projections, receipts, the new
head and the notification all commit together — a subscriber that reacts to the
notification can never read a version that is not there yet.

Idempotency is the command receipt: replaying a command that was already
accepted returns the version it produced instead of appending a second event.
